# DecisionTree_SVM

***Description:***

The data used in this project will help to identify whether a person is going to recover from 
coronavirus symptoms or not based on some pre-defined standard symptoms. These symptoms are 
based on guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO).


This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 
2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on 
any given day is the cumulative number. 



The dataset contains 14 major variables that will be having an impact on whether someone has 
recovered or not, the description of each variable are as follows,
1. Country: where the person resides
2. Location: which part in the Country
3. Age: Classification of the age group for each person, based on WHO Age Group Standard
4. Gender: Male or Female 
5. Visited_Wuhan: whether the person has visited Wuhan, China or not
6. From_Wuhan: whether the person is from Wuhan, China or not
7. Symptoms: there are six families of symptoms that are coded in six fields.
13. Time_before_symptoms_appear: 
14. Result: death (1) or recovered (0)


Two different Classifiers were used: Decision Trees and SVM to predict whether someone will recover or not.
